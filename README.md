# AI_And_Deep_Learning
This repository contains my coursework from the Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning Course (MSDS 458) at Northwestern University.
The contents primarily consist of Python projects focused on neural networks (including artificial neural netowrks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks), deep generative learning, and reinforcement learning.
